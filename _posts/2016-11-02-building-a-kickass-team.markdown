<p>I am assuming that you have your founding members, you have built part of your product and you hopefully have a little traction at this point. This is awesome! Now, you are like we need to hire ASAP because we need help. Wait for a second mate... </p>

<p>This may be the first time in your whole life that you get to choose the people you are going to work with. You should be excited AF. However, you should stop right there and think about it.</p>

<br>
<br>

<p>Do I really need an employee? Can I keep going a few more weeks without bringing someone in? You may also want to consider if you are going to need someone for the next years or only for a few months.</p>

<p>Hiring someone means that you are going to increase the burn rate and you are going to slow your decision-making process. You may not notice it right away, but after 3, 4, 5 you are gonna start noticing.</p> 

<strong>Hire only if you have a desperate need to.</strong>
<br>
<br>

<p>Okay, so now you desperately need an employee and you want to hire him yesterday. If that's the case, then you should have started branding yourself as an awesome employer a while back. This is important because it is going to attract the best talents out there. This can make a big difference if you are trying to poach people.</p>

<strong>Start your employer branding before you start recruiting.</strong>
<br>
<br>

<p>The first couple of employees should be smart people and not only doers. You want to hire smart people because they will be able to adapt and make good decisions. It means you don't have to put in place a shit load of procedure for anything. You give them the basic of the structure and they will do what needs to be done. This way you also avoid micro-managing everyone and you can focus on your priorities.</p>

<strong>Hire the smartest people</strong>
<br>
<br>

<p>It does not mean you should not take care of them. As a hiring manager, it is part of your role to give constant feedback to everyone. This is an important aspect of onboarding a new team member and it has a big impact on the performance as well as retention. You should not wait three months before you sit with your team to give them feedback. Do it on a regular basis and you will see an enormous difference in the performance.</p>

<strong>Give feedback quickly and constantly.</strong>
<br>
<br>

<p>You should always keep your ears open and listen to the feedback they have to give you. They can also help you to become better at managing your team. At the end of the day, the team should help everyone improve and be better every single day.</p>

<strong>Listen to your team's feedback.</strong>
<br>
<br>

<p>The sad part about all this... sometimes you still need to fire someone. Do it quickly to avoid collateral damage. We all do some mistakes, but the difference between winning and losing is how quickly you admit it and fix it. A bad hire can literally kill the company.</p>

<strong>Fire swiftly and move on!</strong>

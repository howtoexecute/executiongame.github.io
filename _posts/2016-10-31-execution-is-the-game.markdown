<p><em>Have you heard that line before? "An idea is worth nothing without execution"</em></p>
<br>

<p>I don't think I have ever met someone willing to challenge that. You may have a great idea, but if you can't execute.. well you are not going anywhere pal. On the other end, you may have a very ordinary idea combined with a laser-focused execution and you will succeed.</p>

<p>Execution is - indeed - the game. It is 99% execution and the tiny 1% leftover is your idea. (the percentage is arguable, the outcome of a great execution is not)</p>

<p><b>What is execution?</b></p>

<p>Execution is all about doing. It is all the things you do in your day-to-day to achieve your business goals</p>


<p><b>Why execution is such a deal breaker?</b></p>

<p>There are two critical aspects strategy and execution. You need to know what to do and then you need to do it right. Your execution doesn't have to be perfect. However, the more things you get right, the higher are your chance of success. The landscape is always changing and you need to adapt your execution. Some people have the knowledge of what needs to be done, but they can't maintain enough focus to do it and for other people, it is the complete opposite. Whether you are working alone or as a team, you need focus and commitment to figure out what to do and then do it.</p>

<p>Nobody is pretending anything here, but there are some key principles that can lead you a long way when it comes to execution for your startup. At the end of the day, execution will make a difference.</p>

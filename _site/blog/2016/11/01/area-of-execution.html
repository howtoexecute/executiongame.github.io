    <p><strong>Team, Product &amp; Growth!</strong></p>

<p>It is a little bit more complicated than "get this right and you will succeed", but these three things are crucial. Team, product, and growth are the three variables you can control on a day-to-day basis and you must pay very good attention to them.</p>

<p>The priority changes depending on your business stage and that is up to you to figure it out. Plus, you need to keep your eyes on the ball while watching the other two. That's why execution is so hard. You need all three to succeed, if only one of the three goes south, you are screwed! As a starting point, I think you should tackle everything in this specific order</p>

<h3>Team</h3>

<p>Your team is the first thing you should focus on. You need to make sure you surround yourself with the best people from day 1. You would rather have an A-team with a B-product than a B-team with an A-product. A great team can turn a business around when the product sucks but a great product won't save a bad team during tough days.</p>

<p>Choosing a team is a critical part of your execution. From the founding members to your first employees, you need to hire awesome people. By awesome I mean, smart and fun to work with. I don't want to scare the shit out of you, but a bad decision can cost you your company.</p>

<ul>
	<li>A- You want to be surrounded by people who are equally smart at the very least or smarter.</li>
	<li>B- You want everyone to have the same vision, values, motivation and passion for what you are building.</li>
	<li>C- You want a complementary and multidisciplinary team.</li>
	<li>D- You want someone you will enjoy spending your life with. You're in for a hell of a ride!</li>
</ul>

<h3>Product</h3>

<p>You are gonna be selling this, so you better be god damn proud of it. However, you need to balance high quality and speed of delivery. You need to understand that sometimes it is better to ship a not-so-perfect product quickly than a perfect product too late.</p>

<p>Developing a successful product remains something pretty hard even nowadays. A lot of products fail every day and every year. While some people have the ability to develop products with intuition, most of us need to rely on real data. It doesn't mean your intuition should be left out, but you need to balance that with validation.</p>

<p>It will dramatically increase the success of your product if... </p>

<ul>
	<li>You are solving a meaningful problem for your users.</li>
	<li>You listen to what your users has to say about what you've built so far.</li>
	<li>You develop the features you are sick of hearing about. </li>
</ul>

<h3>Growth</h3>

<p>You won't wake up tomorrow with half a million users. You need to test channels, measure results and figure out what makes sense for your product. This is never ending trial and error because your channel today may not be working tomorrow. Don't dismiss channels because you think they don't work or because your competitors don't use them. In fact, you should use the channels your competitors as dismissed.</p>

<p>Here are the <a href="https://medium.com/swlh/the-19-channels-you-can-use-to-get-traction-93c762d19339#.suid4h632">19 channels of acquisiton</a> proposed by the book "Traction":</p>

<ul>
	<li>Targeting blogs</li>
	<li>Publicity</li>
	<li>Search engine marketing</li>
	<li>Unconventional PR</li>
	<li>Search engine optimization</li>
	<li>Social and display ads</li>
	<li>Offline ads</li>
	<li>Content marketing</li>
	<li>Email marketing</li>
	<li>Viral marketing</li>
	<li>Engineering as marketing</li>
	<li>Business Development</li>
	<li>Sales</li>
	<li>Affiliate programs</li>
	<li>Existing platforms</li>
	<li>Trade shows</li>
	<li>Offline events</li>
	<li>Speaking engagements</li>
	<li>Community building</li>
</ul>

<p>You don't want to spend too much money on acquisition if you have a leaking bucket at the other end. By leaking bucket I mean a product that has a bad retention. Every product has a breaking point where your retention is too bad to continue growing. This will happen regardless of the amount of money spent because at one point you either don't have enough money to sustain or you can't acquire more users.The best and least expensive way to grow remains to increase your retention.</p>

<p><br />
<br /></p>

<p><strong>Team + Product + Growth â‰  100% chance of success.</strong></p>

<p><small>However, you are making damn sure you are on the right track.</small></p>

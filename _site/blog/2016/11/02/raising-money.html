    <p>The first thing you need to know about raising money is that <strong>you should try not to raise money.</strong> It makes everything a lot more complex and you also have more pressure on yourself. If you have the opportunity to build a business and fuel your growth without giving away equity, TAKE IT.</p>

<p>Now, if you need to raise money, make it a priority and get it done as quickly as possible. It is a big source of distraction and it is time-consuming. First, assign one and only one person to the task. Second, <strong>try to schedule all your meetings in the shortest time span possible.</strong> Here is a trick from "How to start a startup", tell everyone you want a meeting in two or three weeks because you have a truckload of things to take care of for a new release or something. They are more likely to have openings in their schedule and you look like you don't really need their money. This will help you reduce the time spent on this task.</p>

<p>The tough part is usually to get meetings with investors and for that, there are no magic tricks. Go out and meet people. You are <strong>looking for someone who can introduce you to his own investors</strong> or if you have past investors use them.</p>

<p>Another thing to consider is that you are going to ask them money. Technically, they are in a position of power. You should be looking for ways to reverse that. The word on the street is that the best way to raise money is to make your business better.</p>

<p><strong>Don't wait until you need money to create relationships with investors.</strong> You should call for a meeting just to tell them where we are now and where we will be in 2 months or 3 months. You need to show them that you are getting traction and that you are doing what it takes to succeed. That's obviously easier to do if you already have relations with investors</p>

<p>How much money should be raised? This is also a tricky one because there are a few elements to consider. When you are raising, too much money is as bad as not enough. If you raise too much capital, you will probably end up giving too much equity or your valuation will be too high. If you don't raise enough capital, you may not be able to reach your milestone making it difficult to raise another round.</p>

<p>Basically, you need to figure out <strong>how much money you need in the bank to achieve the next big milestone </strong>of your company. It is time to use your spreadsheet skills. How much time do you need to achieve the milestone and how much are you going to spend during those months? You can use your current burn rate and how much you expect it to grow to figure this out.</p>

<p>Once you have the money, don't go crazy. It is easy to spend all this money the wrong way. Instead, you should increase your burn rate progressively. A new employee the first month, increase the marketing budget the next month, get a bigger office the month after, etc. <strong>Running out of cash is the number one reason of failure at venture-backed startups.</strong></p>

    <p><em>Have you heard that line before? "An idea is worth nothing without execution"</em></p>
<p><br /></p>

<p>I don't think I have ever met someone willing to challenge that. You may have a great idea, but if you can't execute.. well that ain't shit pal. On the other end, you may have a very ordinary idea combined with a laser-focused execution and you will succeed.</p>

<p>Execution is - indeed - the game. It is 99% execution and the tiny 1% leftover is your idea. (the percentage is arguable, the outcome of a great execution is not)</p>

<p><b>What is execution?</b></p>

<p>By definition, "the carrying out or putting into effect of a plan, order, or course of action." I think by definition it is crystal clear, but let's adapt it. This is a bunch of items on your to-do lists, sometimes following a very specific order, that you need to get right in order to build a thriving business. Execution is your everyday actions and your every month, quarter or year priorities.</p>

<p><b>Why execution is such a deal breaker?</b></p>

<p>There is two critical aspect in the execution, knowing and doing. You need to know what to do and then you need to do what you know. Your execution doesn't have to be perfect. However, you need to get as many things right as possible. "Many" is not a fixed number and it depends on a shit load of things. It is an always changing landscape. Some people know, but they can't do and for other people it is the opposite. Whether you are working alone or as a team, you need focus and commitment to figure out what to do and then doing it.</p>

<p>Nobody is pretending anything, but there are some key principles combined with experience that can lead you a long way when it comes to executing for your startup.</p>
